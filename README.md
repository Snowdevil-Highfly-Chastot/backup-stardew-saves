<h1>Back-up Stardew Valley Saves</h1>
<h3>Current Usage</h3>
Running this will copy all saves into a folder with the name of the current date/time. The folder is set to be saved in the G:\ drive, which in my case is my Google drive. This is to allow cross-platform access. I have this repository setup just as a backup for the script.
<h3>Your Usage</h3>
I'm using this repo as a backup, but if you stumbled accross this, the small snippet of code is open for usage/modifying. Have fun!
